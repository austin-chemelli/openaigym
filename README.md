## CartPole Problem 
This repository documents work done by the Open AI Gym Subteam of the Future Computing with Rogues Gallery VIP. Currently, the team is investigating the CartPole problem. The CartPole problem is also referred to as the "Inverted Pendulum" problem. With the pole's center of mass being above the pivot point, the system becomes unstable. The goal of the problem is to move the cart left and right to balance the pole, and keep it from falling. An illustration of the problem is shown below:
